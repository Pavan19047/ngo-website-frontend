## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Fails**
- Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Review build logs in Netlify dashboard

**Images Not Loading**
- Ensure images are in `public/` folder
- Check image paths (use `/image.jpg` not `./image.jpg`)
- Verify image file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**404 Errors**
- Check `netlify.toml` redirects configuration
- Verify Next.js routing setup
- Ensure static export is configured correctly

**Slow Loading**
- Optimize images before upload
- Check for large dependencies
- Review Netlify Analytics for bottlenecks

## Helpful Commands

```bash
# Test build locally
pnpm build && pnpm start

# Check build output
ls -la out/

# Netlify CLI commands
netlify status
netlify open
netlify logs
```
